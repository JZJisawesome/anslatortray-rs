A simple Rust library to translate from English to Pig Latin!

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Wikipedia's definition of Pig Latin</a> is "a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix."

Essentially, the word is reorganized in an effort to hide its true meaning, which can be lots of fun!

The Anslatortray library can help out by converting any English text into Pig Latin quickly and easily.
